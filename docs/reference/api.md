# HTTP API

Everything the web UI does goes through this API, so anything the UI can do you
can script.

All routes are under `/api`. Everything except `/api/auth/*` requires the login
cookie.

```bash
curl -s -c jar -X POST localhost:4100/api/auth/login \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"password":"…"}'

curl -s -b jar localhost:4100/api/sessions
```

## Auth

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/auth/status` | `{ authRequired, authed }` |
| `POST /api/auth/login` | `{ password }` → sets the cookie |

## Workspaces

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/workspaces` | `{ root, workspaces: [{ name, path, isGit }] }` |
| `POST /api/workspaces` | `{ name }` → creates a directory; the name is slugified |

## Sessions

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/sessions` | `{ sessions, executor }` — pinned first, then most recent. Task sessions only. |
| `GET /api/agent/sessions` | `{ sessions, agentHome }` — conversations reached through a channel, each with the channel that owns it |
| `POST /api/sessions` | `{ workspace, title? }` |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id` | One session |
| `PATCH /api/sessions/:id` | `{ title?, pinned? }` |
| `DELETE /api/sessions/:id` | Stops it if running, then deletes it and its events |

A session:

```json
{
  "id": "12_A1zVAa2rk",
  "title": "test-project",
  "workspace": "/workspaces/test-project",
  "executor": "host",
  "status": "idle",
  "pinned": false,
  "live": true,
  "created_at": "…",
  "updated_at": "…",
  "last_error": null
}
```

`status` is one of `idle`, `running`, `error`, `interrupted`. `live` is whether
a pi process is up right now, which is not the same thing — an idle session can
still be live.

## Workspace files

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id/files?path=` | `{ path, entries: [{ name, dir, size }] }` — one folder of the session's workspace, folders first |
| `POST /api/sessions/:id/download` | `{ rules, exclude }` → a zip, streamed. Also accepts the same JSON in a `spec` form field. |

`rules` maps workspace-relative paths to `true` or `false`; each path takes
the value of its nearest ruled ancestor, and `""` is the workspace itself
(included unless ruled otherwise). `exclude` is a list of shell-style patterns:
one without a slash matches a name at any depth (`node_modules`, `*.log`), one
with a slash matches from the workspace root (`build/cache`). Symlinks are
skipped.

```json
{ "rules": { "": false, "src": true, "src/fixtures": false }, "exclude": ["*.log"] }
```

## Prompting

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/sessions/:id/prompt` | `{ message }` |
| `POST /api/sessions/:id/abort` | Stop the current run |
| `POST /api/sessions/:id/ui-response` | `{ id, value?, cancelled? }` — answer an extension dialog |

`prompt` returns as soon as pi accepts the message, **not** when the work
finishes. Watch the event stream for progress.

A message matching a portal builtin is handled without reaching the model — see
[Slash commands](/guide/commands).

## Events

```
GET /api/sessions/:id/events?since=<seq>
```

Server-sent events. Replays everything after `since`, then tails live. Each
message is one event:

```json
{ "seq": 78, "type": "portal_notice", "payload": { "text": "…" } }
```

Track the highest `seq` you have seen and pass it as `since` when reconnecting.

::: warning Negative seq
Live-only events — extension dialogs — carry a negative `seq`. They are never
persisted, so they must not move your cursor. Ignore anything `<= 0` when
tracking position, or reconnecting will skip real history.
:::

Types worth knowing: `portal_prompt`, `portal_status`, `portal_notice`,
`agent_end`, `extension_ui_request`, `extension_ui_cancel`, `extension_error`,
`stderr`, plus everything pi emits.

## Session config

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id/config` | `{ state, thinking, models, stats }` |
| `POST /api/sessions/:id/config` | `{ provider?, modelId?, thinkingLevel?, autoCompaction?, autoRetry? }` |
| `POST /api/sessions/:id/compact` | Compact now |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id/commands` | The slash command palette |

`GET` starts pi if it is not already up, so the values are live rather than
guessed. The response carries context usage and token counts.

`POST` returns `{ ok, applied, state }`, where `applied` lists what actually
changed. Only those fields are persisted — an effort change does not rewrite the
model.

`compact` fails with a message when the session is too short for pi to bother.

## Portal settings

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/settings` | `{ settings, stored, defaults, piSettingsPath, executor, workspaceRoot }` |
| `PUT /api/settings` | `{ provider?, model?, thinkingLevel? }` |

`settings` is what pi is launched with; `stored` is only your explicit
overrides; `defaults` is what an unset field falls back to. An empty string in
`PUT` clears an override rather than storing a blank.

## pi extensions

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/packages` | Raw `pi list` output |
| `POST /api/packages` | `{ spec }` |
| `DELETE /api/packages` | `{ spec }` |
| `POST /api/packages/update` | Update everything |
| `GET /api/extensions` | Parsed packages with their recovered settings |
| `PUT /api/extensions/settings` | `{ key, value }` — empty value removes the key |
| `GET /api/pi-settings` | Raw `settings.json` |
| `PUT /api/pi-settings` | `{ content }` — refused unless it parses as JSON |

## Channels

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/channels` | `{ channels, kinds, broken, agentHome, channelsDir }` |
| `POST /api/channels` | `{ kind, name, config }` |
| `PATCH /api/channels/:id` | `{ name?, slug?, enabled?, config?, instructions? }` |
| `DELETE /api/channels/:id` | Keeps its conversations; `?sessions=delete` discards them too |
| `POST /api/channel-packages` | `{ spec }` — install a channel package |
| `DELETE /api/channel-packages/:name` | Uninstall; refuses builtins |

A channel's `slug` is what agent sessions are keyed on, and it survives the
channel being deleted and recreated. Creating a channel with an explicit `slug`
reconnects it to the conversations that slug already had.

Secrets are never returned. A channel carries `secretsSet` listing which secret
fields have a value, and sending a blank secret keeps the stored one.

`broken` lists packages that failed to load, with the reason.
