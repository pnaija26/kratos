# The agent's browser

::: tip Docker installation
See [Docker add-ons](/guide/add-ons) for installation, controls and profile cleanup.
:::

Optional. Nothing here is installed, pulled or shown unless you ask for it.

A real browser, in its own container, with a profile that stays signed in. You
log into it once by hand; every run after that finds the accounts already there.
**No password ever passes through the model.**

## Installing it

**Settings → Add-ons → Browser → Install.** Nothing to edit, nothing to
redeploy. It is not in `docker-compose.yml` and never was for you: a deployment
that never installs it has no image, no container, and no Browser page.

Set a password when asked — this holds live sessions for the agent's accounts,
and there is a button to generate one.

Two ways it can run, chosen for you rather than configured:

| | When | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Container** | the portal can reach the Docker socket | Its own container, pulled on install. Costs nothing until you install it. |
| **Local Chrome** | it cannot | The browser already on the machine, same profile directory. Nothing downloaded. |

The local path is mostly the portal run from source. It goes headless when there
is no display, and says so — sign-in pages refuse headless browsers often
enough to matter.

**Remove** takes the container away and keeps the profile, so installing again
finds the logins still there.

## Logging in

Browser tool responses use on-demand snapshots to keep model context small.
Actions return status without repeating the entire page. The agent uses
`browser_find` for matching text and element references. An explicit
`browser_snapshot({})` returns the full accessibility tree without an imposed
depth limit. Targeted snapshots and optional depth limits are available when
the agent only needs a particular section.

**Browser → Open browser** in the portal, or `https://<host>:3011` directly.
That is a full Chromium in a web page: sign into whatever the agent should have,
then close the tab. The profile lives on its own volume and survives restarts.

### Embedded, or in a tab

The portal proxies the browser's UI at `/browser-ui`, so **Open browser** shows
it inline with a fullscreen button, using the portal's own certificate and
credential. No second password, no second certificate.

That needs the portal itself on HTTPS. The VNC client gates on
`isSecureContext`, and a frame only counts as secure when **every page above it**
does — so an HTTPS frame inside an HTTP portal fails exactly as plain HTTP
would. Without TLS the page says so and offers a tab instead.

Give the portal a certificate:

```
PORTAL_TLS_DIR=/etc/kratos/certs
PORTAL_TLS_CERT=/certs/portal.crt
PORTAL_TLS_KEY=/certs/portal.key
```

A self-signed pair is enough:

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/kratos/certs && cd /etc/kratos/certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 3650 \
  -keyout portal.key -out portal.crt -subj "/CN=kratos"
```

On a tailnet, `tailscale cert <machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net` gives a real one and
no warnings at all.

The direct port still works if you would rather not: `https://<host>:3011`, with
`BROWSER_USER` and `BROWSER_PASSWORD`, and its own self-signed certificate to
accept.

Give the agent **its own accounts** rather than sharing yours. That is what
makes it a teammate rather than a proxy, and it keeps a colleague's request from
reaching your personal mail.

## Letting the agent drive it

The browser reaches the agent as MCP tools. Add one server in
[Settings → MCP](/guide/mcp):

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest", "--cdp-endpoint", "http://127.0.0.1:9222"]
  }
}
```

`--cdp-endpoint` is the whole trick: it **attaches to the running browser**
instead of launching one. A Playwright MCP server without it starts its own
throwaway Chromium, which is signed into nothing.

::: warning Do not run both
A second, headless Playwright server is a way around everything on this page —
its own browser, no profile, no allowlist. If you have one, remove it.
:::

## Who may drive it

Off by default, everywhere. Turned on per session and per routine — a routine's
own page has the switch.

Deliberately **not** gated on who is speaking. The agent has its own accounts and
uses them as itself, including when it is helping a colleague. What balances
that is visibility: every page it opens is recorded in [Audit](/guide/security).

## Where it may go

**Browser → Where it may go** takes one domain per line, `*.example.com` for
subdomains. Empty means no restriction — the per-session switch is the gate, and
a list nobody filled in should not quietly block everything.

::: warning This is a check, not a wall
It is applied when the agent asks for a URL. A page that redirects itself is not
covered, and neither is a request the agent makes through the debugging protocol
rather than by navigating. Real enforcement is a filtering proxy in front of the
browser, which is not built yet.
:::

## The debugging port

Chromium exposes `127.0.0.1:9222`, and that port is **unauthenticated**. Whoever
reaches it owns every account the browser is signed into.

Host networking is what keeps it to the box. Never publish it, never put it
behind a reverse proxy, and treat the profile volume as the secret it is.

### Screenshot images

The portal requests inline image data for browser screenshots. In the pinned
Playwright version, providing `filename` suppresses the image block, leaving
only a file link. The portal removes that argument from screenshot calls;
Playwright still saves the screenshot under an automatic filename. Capture
options such as target, full-page, scale, and format remain available.

Snapshot output uses compact notation: `[eN]` or `[fNeN]` is the exact element
reference, an omitted role means `generic`, and `[pointer]` means a pointer
cursor. The tree retains its nodes, text, URLs and state; this formatting does
not impose a depth limit or truncate content.
